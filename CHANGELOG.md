# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- PKGBUILD `pkgname` and `pkgver` (and related scalar fields) now resolve bash-style variable substitutions such as `"tde-${_mod}"` and `"14.1.$_minor"` without invoking bash
- Pytest could not import `apb` when run outside the project venv; `pythonpath` and explicit src-layout packaging are now configured in `pyproject.toml`

### Changed

- Refactored buildroot host config copy in `setup_buildroot()` to loop over config filenames

## [2026-06-30]

### Added

- Python package layout under `src/apb/` with shared library modules
- `pyproject.toml` with console script entry points (`apb`, `apb-farm`, `apb-server`)
- Unified PKGBUILD parser, config loader, architecture helpers, and tarball utilities
- Jinja2-based minimal HTML templates for server and farm web UI
- `httpx` as unified HTTP client (replaces `aiohttp` and `requests`)

### Changed

- Restructured monolithic `apb.py`, `apb-farm.py`, and `apb-server.py` into installable package modules
- Farm build proxy routes consolidated via shared proxy helpers

### Fixed

- Client `get_builds_by_pkgname()` now uses `/builds/pkgname/` endpoint path

### Removed

- Standalone root-level `apb.py`, `apb-farm.py`, and `apb-server.py` scripts (replaced by package entry points)
